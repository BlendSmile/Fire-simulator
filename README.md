a fire simulator created with c# windows forms project

description:
you're a beginner on 2d animations? And you having some troubles when trying to make a fire effect? Well, your problem is being solved!
I know it's hard to draw a fire effect with mouse, so i made this with c#. All you need to do to generate a fire is just setting some 
numbers for example : sensitivity, tail, tail high, tail numbers and more! After that, you can export it to PNG, Jpeg, Bitmap sequences.

Fire Simulator is already exist on itch.io : https://blendsmile.itch.io/fire-simulator
